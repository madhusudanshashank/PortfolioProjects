#COVID-19 Data Exploration

Overview
This project focuses on the exploration and analysis of COVID-19 data using various SQL skills, including Joins, CTEs, Temp Tables, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types. The project covers a wide range of metrics to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic on different regions and populations.

Skills Used
Joins: Utilized to combine data from multiple tables, linking information from CovidDeaths, CovidVaccinations, and other datasets.

CTEs (Common Table Expressions): Employed to create temporary result sets, enhancing the readability and efficiency of queries.

Temp Tables: Created temporary tables to store intermediate results and facilitate complex calculations.

Windows Functions: Applied window functions to perform calculations over specific partitions or ranges of data.

Aggregate Functions: Used aggregate functions to compute summary statistics, such as maximum infection count and total death count.

Creating Views: Created views to store reusable queries for later visualization and analysis.

Converting Data Types: Ensured data consistency by converting data types when necessary.

Project Queries
The queries cover a diverse set of analyses, including but not limited to:

Likelihood of dying if contracting COVID-19 in a specific country.
Percentage of the population infected with COVID-19.
Countries with the highest infection and death rates compared to population.
Breakdown of metrics by continent.
Global numbers of new cases, total cases, and death percentages.
Analysis of total population vs. vaccinations.
